# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: neglecting to handle promise rejections within asynchronous route handlers.  When an asynchronous operation (like a database query) fails, the error is often silently ignored, leading to unexpected behavior.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.

## Problem
The original code omits proper error handling in the `.catch` block of the promise.  If the asynchronous operation (`someAsyncOperation`) fails, the error is logged to the console, but no response is sent back to the client, leading to a hanging request.

## Solution
The solution includes robust error handling within the `.catch` block.  In case of an error, it sends an appropriate error response to the client (e.g., a 500 Internal Server Error), ensuring a more graceful and informative user experience.
